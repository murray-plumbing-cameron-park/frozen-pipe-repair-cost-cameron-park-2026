## What Causes Frozen Pipes?

Frozen pipes occur when water inside the pipe freezes due to low temperatures. The water expands as it freezes, which can cause the pipe to burst. In regions like **Cameron Park**, this typically happens when temperatures drop below freezing for extended periods.

Other factors that can contribute to frozen pipes include:
- Poor insulation in pipes
- Pipes located in unheated areas (attics, crawl spaces, exterior walls)
- Rapid temperature fluctuations

## Factors Influencing Repair Costs

Repair costs for frozen pipes can vary significantly depending on several factors:
1. **Pipe Location**: Pipes located in difficult-to-reach or external areas (attics, basements) are more expensive to repair.
2. **Extent of Damage**: If the pipe has burst, the repair cost will be higher compared to minor freezing issues.
3. **Material of the Pipe**: The cost to repair or replace pipes varies by material (e.g., copper, PEX, PVC).
4. **Labor Costs**: Local plumbing rates in Cameron Park and surrounding areas will impact the overall cost.
5. **Access to the Pipe**: Pipes buried in walls or underground may require additional demolition or excavation.

### Estimated Costs for Common Services:
- **Inspection and diagnosis**: $100–$200
- **Pipe insulation**: $200–$500
- **Pipe replacement (per linear foot)**: $150–$400
- **Burst pipe repair**: $500–$2,000+

## How to Prevent Frozen Pipes

Preventing frozen pipes is the most cost-effective strategy. Here are some tips to help avoid frozen pipes:
1. **Insulate Exposed Pipes**: Use foam sleeves or insulation to cover exposed pipes in unheated areas.
2. **Let Faucets Drip**: Allowing faucets to drip slightly during extremely cold weather helps reduce pressure in pipes.
3. **Seal Cracks and Openings**: Close any gaps around windows, doors, and where pipes enter the home.
4. **Keep Cabinet Doors Open**: Open the doors under kitchen and bathroom sinks to let warmer air circulate around pipes.

## Common Signs of Frozen Pipes

If you're worried about frozen pipes, look out for these common signs:
- **No water flow**: If you turn on a faucet and no water comes out, the pipe feeding that faucet may be frozen.
- **Frost on pipes**: If you notice frost or condensation on a pipe, this is an indicator that water is starting to freeze.
- **Strange odors**: If water can’t flow freely through your plumbing, you may notice odd smells coming from drains.
